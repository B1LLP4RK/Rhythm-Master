# rhythm_master

Application to help learning difficult rhythms for musical purpose.

This project primarily aims to be a rhythmic tool that can help people understand and feel rhythms.
As a guitar player myself, and music being a vast ocean, I have faced difficulties in understanding and feeling concepts such as polyrhythm and off-beat triplets. I wish I had a rhythm player that I can use easily to listen to it first.

To know what they are you can go see this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cCA6I68rWo&ab_channel=Harmonika-sziget%2FHarmonicaIsland) on , and watch Adam Neely's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4TyBe6AHEI&ab_channel=AdamNeely) on 'Why off beat triplets are so difficult?'

App will ultimately provide metronomes and other small games that help people develop rhythmic fundamental and senses.

## Getting Started

The early version of the app isn't out yet.
